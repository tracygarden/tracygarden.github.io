                    <p>
                        Dear Fellow Citizen we (thousands or millions of us all over Earth) invite you to lay aside your differences and join us in acting to slow climate change and avoid our extinction. There are not enough of us yet to do the necessary work. Some say it’s too late but it isn’t.  Many of us have faced our grief and are happier for it. Many of us have already died in the many floods, storms and heat waves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are invited to act whereever you are and in your own way with the talents you have. Work alone or in groups. <b>Here in Kansas City a growing number of us are looking at a hopeful possibility laid out below.</b> With the upcoming leaf season we are going to build hundreds of specially built Johnson-Su compost bioreactors to normalize our deficient soils to increase the fungi. Many fungi send miles of tiny tubes out through the soil to feed plant roots. These tubes are carbon (formally CO2 in the atmosphere) and they can form a soil carbon sponge that will hold a lot of water. Water is THE major greenhouse gas on this planet. Water’s relationship to Carbon and to the Soil is complicated but is laid out in the information below. Please join us. “This caravan has no despair” for we are working for each other.

                    <h2>The Task</h2>
                    <p>
                        The task is to treat all the soil in Kansas City with Johnson-Su Compost. This treatment has been shown to increase the ratio of fungal to bacterial microbes in the soil. The fungi in the soil are made of carbon which is drawn out of the atmosphere by plants. The broken down fungi is sticky and holds soil particles together creating the soil carbon sponge. This spongy soil holds water prolonging the ability of plants to draw down even more carbon through photosynthesis. The added moisture also helps the soil play its original role interacting in the plants climate water cycle.

                    <h2>Toward Reframing Climate Change</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is time that we adequately frame climate change. Until very recently i thought and and talked as though CO2 was the major greenhouse gas and that solutions would come out of sequestering carbon and stopping CO2 emissions. I understand that CO2 is a key player, but that water is by far the major greenhouse gas. If we focus narrowly on reducing CO2 and it belches right back out of the ocean, then we should spend most of our energy on regenerating living soil. Yards, parks, farms and ranches need to be the main focus and where maximum funding goes. It seems to me that most people are focused on sequestering and preventing CO2 from getting in the air. We really need to create the conditions where we put as much CO2 as we can back in the soil where it came from. Our workforce are the trillions upon trillions of organisms that built and have been regulating planetary temperature. Human soil practices have been killing these organisms so they cannot do their jobs. We need to begin immediately.

                        <p>We will use neighborhood sticks and limbs to make charcoal. Then we will treat it with minerals, fertilizer and worm casting tea, mix with compost and apply it to the soil. Charcoal lasts in the soil for hundreds of years, mitigating global warming. Participants will also learn about other aspects of Tracy (community) Garden and opportunities for involvement. Part of our mission is to help people make their own biochar making equipment and we are available to put on demonstrations to groups.</p>

                    <h2>What Is No-till Gardening?</h2>
                    <p>Natural No Till gardening is organic or chemical-free gardening. The soil is not tilled between
                        harvest
                        and planting save for some raking. The soil is either kept covered with mulch or compost, or it
                        is
                        planted in a cover crop to keep carbon fixed in the living soil. No till gardening attempts to
                        reestablish
                        and sustain a healthy, well balanced soil ecology. When living soil is exposed to air and sun by
                        tilling, the carbon in the soil’s organic material is metabolized by bacteria resulting in
                        carbon
                        dioxide which escapes into the atmosphere. Reduction of CO2 emissions is a natural consequence
                        of
                        organic no-till gardening.</p>

                    <h2>Can We Have Your Limbs?</h2>
                    <p>Please consider saving your dry dead limbs for us. We can’t use green limbs because we don’t have
                        the
                        storage space to dry them. We will use the limbs to make biochar to slow global warming and make
                        garden soils more fertile. The sticks need to be 1 3/4 in diameter. It saves our volunteer time
                        if they are 15 inches long or shorter.</p>
                    <p>We can come to your block party or to your neighborhood’s dumpster day to pick up sticks.</p>
                    <p>Email us at
                        <a href="mailto:martyk@allspecies.org">martyk@allspecies.org</a>&nbsp;or call at
                        <a href="tel:816-400-2277">816-400-2277</a>&nbsp;and we’ll arrange to pick them up.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to save your green limbs in your back yard until they are dry we could pick
                        them up
                        then.</p>
                    <p>Contact us if you would like to see Tracy Garden or to watch us make biochar. We welcome schools
                        and
                        groups too.</p>
