                    <h2>Become a Gardener at Tracy Gardens</h2>
                    <h3>Help with the work, learn & take home healthy vegetables.</h3>
                    <p>Do you want to garden with us?</p>
                    <p>Two lots in the Troost Plateau Neighborhood (5630 Tracy) of the 49/63 Neighborhood Coalition are learning/community
                        garden spaces for neighbors and others to learn Carbon Smart Gardening. Carbon Smart Gardening includes
                        being organic, using no chemicals for pest or weed control. It also promotes no-till methods of using
                        mulches, cover crops and timely easy weeding practices. We also promote the building of healthy soil
                        for growing the healthiest vegetables. Our cover crops help by keeping roots in the ground as much
                        as possible. The living roots are constantly feeding the microbes that deliver minerals and water
                        to roots, improving the health of the plants. We are even treating our soil probiotically. We have
                        multiple worm bins from which we brew worm casting tea which is rich in healthy microbes for the
                        soil. In the spring we will start growing mycorrhizal fungi to inoculate roots so they can more easily
                        absorb minerals and water, increasing production. All of these methods are Earth friendly with an
                        eye to keeping carbon in the soil instead of it being in the atmosphere as CO2 and heating up the
                        Earth. The most direct practice of putting carbon in the soil at Tracy Garden is the making of biochar
                        or charcoal. We use wood chips and small sticks (what some call yard waste) to make biochar, then
                        mix with compost and add to the soil. Charcoal lasts much longer in the soil than compost and is
                        at least as good for the soil. It prevents the loss of Nitrogen from the soil and houses microbes.</p>
                    <p>Gardeners will receive hands on learning opportunities through the season in all these methods as well
                        as more root-a-mentry garden practices. We will grow a large variety of vegetables and some fruits.
                        Gardeners will work in groups or individually on tasks as necessity presents. Food grown in the garden
                        will be shared with gardeners according to the time they work.</p>
                    <p>We will do outreach to individuals and organizations to share our methods. Gardeners will not be expected
                        to present to these groups.</p>

                   <!-- <h3>Communiversity Class: Making Biochar and its Soil Applications</h3>
                    <p> <a href="https://ecommerce.umkc.edu/commu/BrowseDetail.aspx?category=home">Communiversity Catalog</a></p>
                        <p>We will use neighborhood sticks and limbs to make charcoal. Then we will treat it with minerals, fertilizer and worm casting tea, mix with compost and apply it to the soil. Charcoal lasts in the soil for hundreds of years, mitigating global warming. Participants will also learn about other aspects of Tracy (community) Garden and opportunities for involvement. Part of our mission is to help people make their own biochar making equipment and we are available to put on demonstrations to groups.</p>

                    <h2>What Is No-till Gardening?</h2>
                    <p>Natural No Till gardening is organic or chemical-free gardening. The soil is not tilled between harvest
                        and planting save for some raking. The soil is either kept covered with mulch or compost, or it is
                        planted in a cover crop to keep carbon fixed in the living soil. No till gardening attempts to reestablish
                        and sustain a healthy, well balanced soil ecology. When living soil is exposed to air and sun by
                        tilling, the carbon in the soil’s organic material is metabolized by bacteria resulting in carbon
                        dioxide which escapes into the atmosphere. Reduction of CO2 emissions is a natural consequence of
                        organic no-till gardening.</p>
                    <p>We have an
                        <a href="http://organotill.org/calendar/">online organic no-till garden calendar</a>&nbsp;where you can watch videos for each seasonal task.</p>

                    <h2>Can We Have Your Limbs?</h2>
                    <p>Please consider saving your dry dead limbs for us. We can’t use green limbs because we don’t have the
                        storage space to dry them. We will use the limbs to make biochar to slow global warming and make
                        garden soils more fertile. Email us at
                        <a href="mailto:martyk@allspecies.org">martyk@allspecies.org</a>&nbsp;or call at
                        <a href="tel:8163611230">816-361-1230</a>&nbsp;and we’ll arrange to pick them up.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to save your green limbs in your back yard until they are dry we could pick them up
                        then.</p>
                    <p>Contact us if you would like to see Tracy Garden or to watch us make biochar. We welcome schools and
                        groups too.</p>
